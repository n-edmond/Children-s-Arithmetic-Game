# Children-s-Arithmetic-Game

The purpose of this assignment is to show proper usage of random, conditional statements, and loops. The goal of this project is simple: children are asked to answer 5 math questions.   Each question will be 2 random numbers from 1 - 10, either added or subtracted.  The player will be allowed 3 guesses.  After the 5 questions are given, they are told how many they got right out of 5 and what their score was.  They are then asked if they want to play again, accepting only Y, N inputs.
